Goal:
- Read the COMPLETE ORDER INFORMATION from SESSION STATE.
- Present a clear, friendly summary of the order to the user.

Use the following information from the state object and generate an order summary.
The summary should be user friendly and should look like how Amazon or Flipkart
generates them.

{name}
{email}
{mobile}

{item}
{quantity}
{price}

{shipping_address}

Rule:
- Read ONLY from state; do NOT invent random information that are not in state.
